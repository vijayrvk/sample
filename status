Its midnight. You wake up abruptly and in confusion thinking it’s time to get up. Then you look at the alarm clock and realize you still have some hours to sleep. A warm euphoric feeling runs through your body as you curl yourself back into the warm blanket smiling.
You're out roaming around. Unconsciously you put your hands in the jeans pocket and feel something. And a smile spreads across your face as you remember about the change from the grocery store you went to a few days back. Congratulations you've gifted yourself a gift. And you're richer than you were a second before. Party Time !!
You are in a grim mood. Nothing is going accordingly. Sad , you pop in your earphones and hit the shuffle button. And the song which plays is exactly the one you were hoping it to be. Grim changes to Grin in a moment as you sway with the music. Everything's fine now and you breathe in peace.
You wake up and find the sky dark. And as you walk into the verandah holding the mug of coffee , drops start falling and you take the shelter of the shed above. Everything seems like a movie around as you spectate the things happening around. People running for a shelter , the breeze carrying the sweet smell and the rumbling of clouds inbetween. And Mom calls from inside for snacks. Bliss.
Sitting on the terrace on a cold full moon night with someone. Someone very close to you. Every time she grabs your hand , you are overcome with an awareness of how much she means to you. And as you curl her fingers in yours time stops. In complete silence , you together feel the serenity. And as she rests her head on your shoulder moment freezes.
The package you ordered online is here. Packed amongst some thermocol pieces and bubble wrap. Time to wake up the kid inside as you start popping those bubbles. Suddenly, the bubble wrap becomes even more significant than the actual package. Guess the revoker of nostalgic memories earns that much privilege.
The project was just too much. You had to work continuously without lifting your head even once. Now finally it is over. And as you finally lift your head up and stretch the whole body , every pain vanishes and a sensation of peace befalls. Time to curl up yourself in bed.
Chocolates. Chocolates hold magic within. Whatever be the situation , when it melts on your tongue, coats your mouth, and satisfies your tastebuds the felling of peace engulfs you itself. Whatever may the problem be , answer is always chocolates.
Sunday. But you woke up early. It's just 4 am. You walk out and sit on the terrace. There is complete silence around. And slowly the sun starts peeking from behind the buildings. sky turns from dark to bright shades of orange, pink, red, and purple. Chirping of birds and the cool air flowing at that moment complete the peace.
Things are a bit different today. You forgot to wear shoes for jogging. But well flip flops won't work out. How about a walk instead ? The green grass with drops looks appealing. You take off the slippers and slowly step into the grass. Walking slowly , feeling the grass, sand, and asphalt under your feet. The cool dew sends a shiver and feeling of relaxation overcomes everything else.
